Hi {Student-Name},

You are receiving this email because our auto-grading script currently gives you 0 points for your CS 301 assignment submission. Please check your submission and resubmit before the deadline.

Your report generated by script:
{Report}

We will change test cases for final test.

Explanation of your report generated by script:
1. 'unexpected indent'/'unindent does not match any outer indentation level'/'expected an indented block'
Try re-indenting your code, and make sure you are using tabs and spaces consistently.

2. 'cannot import name [function name]'
Make sure your function names are correct, and that your parameters match those in the writeup.

3. 'invalid syntax'
Make sure the syntax of your script is correct. Pay special attention to parentheses () on the line BEFORE the one the error mentions.

4. 'unexpected character after line continuation character'
Please use a basic text editor to edit and save your code. We recommend: Atom, Sublime Text, Spyder (the Anaconda IDE).

5. 'invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)'/'EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 1)'
Don't contain special character in your filename. Change your filename to 'hobbes_walk.py' will solve the problem.
