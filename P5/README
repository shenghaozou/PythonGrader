Folders:
1. submissions - student's submissions
2. temp - students didn't guard their 'main' function with if __name__ == '__main__' so I have to use code to delete all extra parts besides functions. If you meet any problems when grading, plz take a look at temp folder. I am not sure whether I made some mistakes in my code. Just search for their own submission id.
3. tester - all the input files.

Tests:
we have 6 grading parts this week. All the test file can be found in tester folder. All the right answer will be found in HTML files, follwed by students' error.

1. calculate_food
I will check:
    1. input_calc_food_1.txt as stdin. args: 'S' & True
    2. input_calc_food_2.txt as stdin. args: 'S' & False
    3. input_calc_food_3.txt as stdin. args: 'F' & True

2. calculate_other
I will check:
    1. input_calc_other_1.txt as stdin

3. calculate_total_invalid(will give invalid input)
I will check:
    1. input_calc_total_invalid.txt, for the output, I will try to find 'invalid' in student's output.

4. calculate_total
I will check:
    1. input_calc_total_1.txt
    2. input_calc_total_2.txt
    3. input_calc_total_3.txt

5. prompt_correct
I will check:
1. input_calc_food_1.txt for calculate_food, only focus on output format.
2. input calc_other_1.txt for calculate_other, only focus on output

6. output_correct
1. input_calc_main_1.txt, only focus on extra thing after the right output.
